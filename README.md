# Project-Dump

This is simply a dump of all my little projects I make, am I just doing this to fill up my contribution activity? Maybe. But I need somewhere to store these because I gotta reset my computer and I dont have a spare drive. Nothing important will be here, besides a few tools that you might like. Its like a garage sale, but everything is free and no old grandma is watching you take her old stuff. Have fun! 

Oh yea: Feel free to use anything in here for any of your projects, just dont claim its yours (Im looking at you deepvr)
